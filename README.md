# CBW's Bookdown Template.

This is the bookdown template for a standard CBW workshop.

*Currently a work-in-progress.*

Development Notes:
- Michelle + Nia can update the photos if they want, they're in img/faculty/. (I just took these off the internet, quality might be bad)
- update favicon.ico with one with highter quality
- in the upper right corner, there is twitter/facebook/other sharing links, they are based on the 
index.Rmd HTML metadata ? - not that important, we can care about this later
 
BUGS:
- Alt text bug, if not immediately following or followed by a paragraph, 
- backup html version: <img src="./img/faculty/nia-hughes.jpeg" alt="Description of the image">
- maybe raise an issue

- figure out good naming convention for files

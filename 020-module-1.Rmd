# (PART) Modules {-}

# Module 1

Put your content (maybe even pdfs and slides ????) here.

These pages should be a rendered and compiled version of your code, if you have code. 

R, python, bash and more can run in bookdown. 

```{r}
# This is R
x <- 42
x
```

```{python}
# This is python
print("hello world")
```

```{bash}
# This is bash
pwd
```

Try running these code "chunks" by pressing the green (left-pointing) triangle next to your code chunks. 

You will see the code run in the console and the output provided below the code chunk.

The output of the code will also be produced under the code chunk on your wesbite page.
